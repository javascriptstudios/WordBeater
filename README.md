# WordBeater
Word beater is a typing test game made entirely in pure JavaScript as of version 1. 

WordBeater has simple JS variables which manages the time according to the difficulty level. It has three difficulty levels and as of now you have to manually change them in the script.

The code is well-written and is easy to understand even for the newbies. I have used multiple comments wherever I felt a need for it, to help anyone understand what the code is doing. 

The original idea behind this game is not mine but rather I've seen it implemented at a couple of places. I only wanted to build it so that I could have a list of words I make most mistakes in and through this I could practice those in my spare time. 

My future goal with WordBeater is to introduce a competitive typing test series with selected words which may help a person get comprehensive training on their QWERTY keyboard. 

Future builds might include:

- Different types of typing tests and word difficulty ((Currently, the difficulty is based on the time limit)).
- A leaderboard feature.
- WordBeater typing competitions so that multiple people at the same time could participate in a test.
